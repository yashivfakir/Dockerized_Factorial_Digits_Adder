# Dockerized Factorial Digits Adder

## About the Project:
The project explores the containerization of a factorial algorithm. The algorithm determines the factorial of an inputted integer number and then sums the digits of the parsed factorial. 

 > **For example**  given an input of 4:
The Factorial of 4 is:

$$
4! =  4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
$$
>**Then,** the summation of the parsed factorial:

$$
Output = 24 =  2 + 4 = 6
$$

### Built With 
The project involved the usage of several development languages/tools and libraries including:
- [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) - High level programming language used to implement the factorial digits summation algorithm.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Python library used to implement all math operations.
- [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html) -  Python library that allows for input to be exchanged from a command line shell to Python script upon the Python script execution.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Used to define and build the image that containerizes the project.

### Repository Contents
The project consists of a .tar.gz compressed folder that includes a Docker build file and the Python script that implements the algorithm.

## Project Implementation:

Before implementing the project, several conditions need to be met in order for a successful implementation.

### Prerequisites
**The first requirements for the project are:**

1. Firstly, since the files are compressed as a .tar.gz file, a decompression program, such as 7-Zip, would be needed to first extract the contents of the compressed file.
2. Secondly, Docker should be installed on the host machine in order to run the containerized application.
